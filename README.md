# Velvet - a Dumb Electron Alternative

Velvet is a C++ framework for building applications based on HTML, CSS and JS.

Velvet provides an easy-to-use Electron-like API so you can easily get started developing your beautiful applications!

## What's the difference?
* **You own the code!** - velvet is `git clone`d right into your source code, not installed through `npm`
* **Full CMake integration** - no bizzare addon / plugin system, you control the build process
* **Compact size** - velvet uses system's WebView and C++ runtime, which makes velvet binaries light like a feather
